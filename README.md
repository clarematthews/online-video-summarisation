# Online video summarisation

Generation of datasets and implementations of methods used in studies of online video summarisation.

See the [project webpage](http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas00a/activities/Leverhulme/project_RPG_2015_188.html) for further details.

## Data

The following function plots the synthetic data set given as parameter:
plot_data_set(<num = 1:7>)

To plot all data sets, run the script PlotAllData.


## Methods

The function online_keyframe_summarisation(<data>, <method>, <params>) runs the online <method> on <data>, using the provided <params>.

The parameters required for each method are described both in the online_keyframe_summarisation function, and in each independent method function.
